To add your custom content you can modify the following files:
### database.json
    Link custom models (glb or gltf format) and audios (mp3|wav|m4a format) with this structure:
    {
        "ID": 0,
        "contentName": "Spot 0",
        "pathModel": "assets/models/ladybug.glb",
        "pathAudioFiles": [
            {
                "path": "assets/audios/test1.mp3",
                "time": 2
            },
            {
                "path": "assets/audios/test2.mp3",
                "time": 8
            }
        ]
    }
    The time corresponds to the start time to play the audio in the timeline
